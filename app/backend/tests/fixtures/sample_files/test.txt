This is a test text file for testing document processing.
It contains sample content that can be used to test the text extraction and chunking functionality.

The file has multiple paragraphs to simulate real document content.
Each paragraph contains enough text to test the chunking algorithm properly.

This is useful for testing scenarios where we need to process text files
instead of PDF files for validation purposes.
