# Alarm Sound Files

This directory should contain:
- `alarm-soft.mp3` - A gentle beeping sound for normal alarms
- `alarm-urgent.mp3` - A more urgent/loud beeping sound for critical alarms

You can:
1. Record your own alarm sounds
2. Download free alarm sounds from freesound.org
3. Use online tone generators to create beeping sounds
4. Convert the WAV files created by the script to MP3

Recommended specifications:
- Format: MP3 or WAV
- Duration: 2-5 seconds
- Volume: Moderate (not too loud to be jarring)
- Frequency: 800-1200 Hz for good audibility

The application will fall back to browser-generated beeps if these files are not available.
